# Interview Methodology Guide

## Core Principles

1. **Open-ended first, specific second**: Start each topic with broad questions, then drill into specifics based on responses
2. **Concrete examples over abstractions**: When someone says "I'm collaborative," ask for a specific recent example
3. **Probe inconsistencies**: If behavior described contradicts artifacts found, ask about it non-judgmentally
4. **Capture the spectrum**: People behave differently in different contexts. Map the range, not just the default
5. **Record verbatim phrasing**: The person's exact words reveal communication style — preserve characteristic phrases

## Interview Flow Per Phase

```
1. Read the phase instruction file
2. Ask the opening question (broad, warm-up)
3. Listen and follow up with probing questions
4. Search MCP sources for corroborating evidence
5. Present findings and ask for corrections
6. Record structured data to profile
7. Save raw transcript
8. Transition to next phase
```

## Questioning Techniques

### The Funnel
- Start broad: "Tell me about your role"
- Narrow: "What's the most important decision you make each week?"
- Specific: "Walk me through the last time you made that decision"

### The Contrast
- "How does your communication differ between your team and executives?"
- "When you agree with a decision vs disagree — how does your response change?"

### The Scenario
- "Imagine your top priority just got deprioritized by leadership. Walk me through what you do next."
- "A teammate delivers work that doesn't meet the bar. How do you handle it?"

### The Artifact Probe
- Find a document/message they wrote via MCP
- "I found this [doc/message]. Can you tell me the context behind it?"
- "Is this representative of how you typically communicate?"

## MCP Source Strategy

### When to query MCP sources
- **Before Phase 1**: Search for role/org docs to have context
- **During Phase 2**: Find actual messages/docs to analyze writing style
- **During Phase 5**: Look at task management, project structures
- **During Phase 7**: Deep dive into 5-10 specific artifacts

### Available MCP tools and when to use them
| Tool | What to search for | When |
|------|-------------------|------|
| Notion search | Role docs, meeting notes, strategy docs, PRDs | Phases 1, 2, 4, 7 |
| Notion fetch | Read specific pages for style/content analysis | Phases 2, 4, 7 |
| Asana search | Tasks, projects, status updates | Phases 1, 5, 7 |
| Asana get_tasks | Specific task patterns, completion history | Phase 5 |
| Browser/Chrome | Any web-accessible work artifacts | Phase 7 |

## Recording Guidelines

### What to record in the profile
- Synthesized patterns (not raw transcripts — those go in phase files)
- Specific examples that illustrate patterns
- The person's own words for key phrases/vocabulary
- Confidence level for each section (high/medium/low based on evidence)

### What to save as transcripts
- The full Q&A exchange for each phase
- Include timestamps and phase markers
- Include any MCP search results referenced

### What to save as artifacts
- Anonymized excerpts from documents analyzed
- Key passages that demonstrate patterns
- Summary of what each artifact revealed

## Transition Phrases

Between phases, summarize what was learned:
- "Great, I have a solid picture of [topic]. Let me summarize what I've captured, and then we'll move to [next topic]."
- Present a brief summary and ask: "Does this accurately reflect how you see yourself in this area? Anything to add or correct?"

## Handling Difficult Situations

### Vague answers
- "Can you give me a specific example from the last month?"
- "If I were watching you do this, what would I see?"

### Reluctance to share
- Acknowledge: "I understand this is personal. Only share what you're comfortable with."
- Explain why: "This helps the agent respond authentically in similar situations."

### Contradictions
- "Earlier you mentioned X, but this document seems to show Y. Can you help me understand the difference?"
- Frame as context-dependent, not wrong: "Maybe it depends on the situation?"

### Running long
- Keep each phase to 15-25 minutes of conversation
- If a phase is going long, capture what you have and note gaps for calibration
