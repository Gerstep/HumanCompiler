# Phase 3: Decision-Making

## Objective
Understand how this person approaches decisions — their frameworks, biases, how they handle uncertainty, and their typical tradeoff patterns.

## MCP Pre-work
- Search Notion for decision docs, post-mortems, strategy docs
- Search Asana for project decisions, priority changes, or milestone updates

## Opening Question
"Let's talk about how you make decisions. Think about a significant decision you made recently at work — walk me through your thought process from start to finish."

## Core Questions

### Decision Framework
1. "When faced with a hard choice, what's the first thing you do?"
2. "Do you tend to rely more on data/analysis or intuition/experience?"
3. "How much input do you seek from others before deciding?"
4. "What information do you need before you feel confident making a call?"
5. "Do you have any explicit frameworks you use (pros/cons, impact/effort, etc.)?"

### Prioritization
6. "When you have more work than time, how do you decide what to focus on?"
7. "How do you balance short-term wins vs. long-term investments?"
8. "When two stakeholders want different things, how do you prioritize?"
9. "How do you decide when something is 'good enough' vs. needs more work?"

### Under Uncertainty
10. "What do you do when you don't have enough information to decide?"
11. "How comfortable are you making reversible decisions quickly?"
12. "Tell me about a time you had to make a call with incomplete data. What happened?"
13. "Do you tend to be more risk-averse or risk-tolerant?"

### Tradeoff Patterns
14. "Speed vs. quality — where do you usually land?"
15. "Innovation vs. stability — how do you balance these?"
16. "Individual contributor work vs. process/coordination — how do you split your time?"
17. "When you disagree with a decision made above you, what do you do?"

### Real Examples
18. "Tell me about a decision you made that turned out great. What made it work?"
19. "Tell me about one that didn't go well. What would you do differently?"
20. "What's the hardest tradeoff you've navigated recently?"

## Follow-up Probes
- "What was the alternative you didn't choose? Why?"
- "Who did you consult? What did they say?"
- "How quickly did you need to decide? Did the timeline affect your approach?"
- "Looking back, would you decide differently?"

## What to Record
```yaml
decision_making:
  framework: [their primary approach to decisions]
  prioritization: [how they prioritize work and competing demands]
  under_uncertainty: [behavior when data is incomplete]
  tradeoff_patterns:
    - [e.g., "Favors speed over perfection for reversible decisions"]
    - [e.g., "Seeks consensus but will override for urgent matters"]
  examples:
    - [brief description of a key decision and outcome]
```

## Transition
"Your decision-making approach is really clear now. Here's what I'm capturing... [summary]. Next, I want to explore your areas of deep expertise — what you know better than most people."
