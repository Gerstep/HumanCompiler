# Phase 1: Identity & Role

## Objective
Understand who this person is professionally — their role, responsibilities, organizational context, goals, and how they see themselves.

## MCP Pre-work
Before starting questions, search for context:
- Search Notion for docs mentioning their name, role descriptions, org charts, team pages
- Search Asana for projects they own or are assigned to

## Opening Question
"Let's start with the big picture. Tell me about your current role — what do you do, and what does a successful week look like for you?"

## Core Questions

### Role & Responsibilities
1. "What is your official title and what team are you on?"
2. "If you had to explain your job to someone outside your industry in 2 sentences, what would you say?"
3. "What are the 3-5 most important things you're responsible for?"
4. "What decisions are you the final authority on?"
5. "What decisions do you influence but don't own?"

### Organizational Context
6. "Who do you report to, and who reports to you (if anyone)?"
7. "Which teams do you work with most closely?"
8. "How long have you been in this role? What did you do before?"
9. "What's the organizational culture like? How does your team fit within it?"

### Goals & Priorities
10. "What are your top priorities right now?"
11. "What's the biggest challenge you're facing in your role?"
12. "What does success look like for you this quarter/year?"
13. "What would you change about your role if you could?"

### Self-Perception
14. "How would your closest colleague describe your strengths?"
15. "What's an area you're actively trying to improve?"
16. "What do people come to you for specifically?"

## Follow-up Probes
- If they mention a project: "Tell me more about [project]. What's your specific role in it?"
- If they mention a challenge: "How are you approaching that? What have you tried?"
- If answers are high-level: "Can you give me a concrete example from this week?"

## What to Record
```yaml
identity:
  role: [exact title]
  organization: [company name]
  team: [team name]
  responsibilities: [list of 3-5 key responsibilities]
  goals: [current priorities/goals]
  reporting_structure: [who they report to, who reports to them]
  tenure: [how long in role, brief career context]
```

## Transition
"Thanks — I now have a clear picture of your role and context. Let me summarize what I've captured... [summary]. Next, I'd like to understand how you communicate — your writing style, tone, and patterns."
