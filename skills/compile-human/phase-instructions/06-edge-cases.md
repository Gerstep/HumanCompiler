# Phase 6: Edge Cases & Difficult Situations

## Objective
Understand how this person behaves in non-typical situations — conflicts, ambiguity, failures, pressure, and ethical dilemmas. These edge cases are what differentiate a shallow persona from a deep behavioral model.

## MCP Pre-work
- Search Notion for post-mortems, incident reports, retrospectives
- Search Asana for blocked/stalled tasks, escalations

## Opening Question
"We've covered how you work in normal conditions. Now I want to understand how you handle the hard stuff. Think about the last time something went wrong at work — what happened and what did you do?"

## Core Questions

### Conflict Resolution
1. "When you disagree with a colleague, how do you handle it?"
2. "What about when you disagree with your manager or leadership?"
3. "Tell me about a time you had a serious disagreement at work. How did it play out?"
4. "Do you tend to address conflict directly or try to find a workaround?"
5. "How do you give difficult feedback to someone?"

### Handling Ambiguity
6. "When you get a vague request with no clear direction, what do you do first?"
7. "How much ambiguity can you tolerate before you need to clarify?"
8. "When the right answer isn't clear, how do you move forward?"
9. "Tell me about a time you had to figure something out with very little guidance."

### Failure Response
10. "When you make a mistake, what's your first reaction?"
11. "How do you communicate failures or bad news to stakeholders?"
12. "Tell me about a significant failure and how you handled it."
13. "How do you recover from a setback? What's your process?"

### Pressure & Stress
14. "How does your behavior change when you're under heavy pressure?"
15. "What do you do when a deadline is impossible but expected?"
16. "How do you handle being asked to do something you think is wrong?"
17. "When do you push back vs. comply with something you disagree with?"

### Scenario-Based Questions
18. "Your biggest project just got cancelled. What do you do in the first 24 hours?"
19. "A teammate is consistently underperforming and it's affecting the team. How do you handle it?"
20. "You realize a decision you championed was wrong after the team committed to it. What's your move?"
21. "A stakeholder makes an unreasonable demand with executive backing. How do you respond?"
22. "You discover a significant problem that nobody else has noticed yet. What do you do?"

## Follow-up Probes
- "What was going through your mind at that point?"
- "Did you consider any other approaches? Why did you choose this one?"
- "If the same situation happened again tomorrow, would you do anything differently?"
- "How did others react to your approach?"

## What to Record
```yaml
edge_cases:
  conflict_resolution: [their approach to disagreements and difficult conversations]
  ambiguity_handling: [how they deal with unclear situations]
  failure_response: [how they react to and recover from failures]
  scenarios:
    - situation: [description of scenario]
      response: [how they said they'd respond, with reasoning]
    - situation: [another scenario]
      response: [their response pattern]
```

## Transition
"These edge cases are incredibly valuable — they're what will make your agent truly authentic. Here's what I captured... [summary]. Now I'd like to do a deep dive into some of your actual work artifacts to extract patterns I might have missed."
