# Phase 4: Domain Expertise

## Objective
Map this person's knowledge landscape — what they know deeply, what they know broadly, their technical skills, and industry-specific knowledge.

## MCP Pre-work
- Search Notion for docs they authored that reveal expertise (technical docs, strategy docs, guides, how-tos)
- Search Asana for projects in their domain areas
- Look for any code repositories, technical reviews, or specifications they've contributed to

## Opening Question
"Let's map out what you know. If I asked your team 'What's [name] the expert on?' — what would they say?"

## Core Questions

### Core Domains
1. "What are the 2-3 topics where you'd consider yourself an expert?"
2. "For each of those — how did you build that expertise? How long?"
3. "What do people specifically come to you for advice on?"
4. "Are there topics where you're the only person on the team with deep knowledge?"

### Technical Skills
5. "What tools, technologies, or methodologies are you most proficient with?"
6. "Are there technical concepts you can explain that most people in your role can't?"
7. "What's a common misconception in your field that you know the truth about?"
8. "If someone asked you to teach a 1-hour masterclass, what would the topic be?"

### Industry Knowledge
9. "What industry trends do you follow closely?"
10. "Who are the thinkers/leaders in your space that influence your work?"
11. "What's your perspective on the biggest shift happening in your industry right now?"
12. "Are there frameworks, methodologies, or philosophies from your industry that guide your thinking?"

### Knowledge Boundaries
13. "What adjacent areas do you know enough about to be dangerous but not expert?"
14. "Where do your knowledge gaps lie? What do you rely on others for?"
15. "Is there an area you're actively learning right now?"

### Deep Dive
16. "Pick your strongest area of expertise. Explain something non-obvious about it that most people miss."
17. "What's the most nuanced or counterintuitive thing you've learned in this domain?"
18. "How do you stay current in your areas of expertise?"

## Follow-up Probes
- "How would you explain [topic] to a smart person with no background in it?"
- "What's the difference between someone who's good at this vs. great?"
- "Can you point me to something you've written that demonstrates this expertise?"

## What to Record
```yaml
expertise:
  domains:
    - name: [domain name]
      depth: [beginner/intermediate/advanced/expert]
      details: [specific knowledge, unique insights, how they apply it]
    - name: [domain name]
      depth: [level]
      details: [details]
  technical_skills:
    - [skill 1]
    - [skill 2]
  industry_knowledge:
    - [key insight or perspective 1]
    - [key insight or perspective 2]
```

## Transition
"I've got a strong map of your expertise now. Here's what I see... [summary]. Next, let's talk about your day-to-day work patterns — how you organize your time, the tools you use, and how you collaborate."
