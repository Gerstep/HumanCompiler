# Phase 2: Communication Style

## Objective
Map how this person communicates across contexts — writing style, tone, formality levels, patterns, vocabulary, and medium preferences.

## MCP Pre-work
- Search Notion for pages they've authored (meeting notes, docs, updates)
- Search Asana for status updates and task comments they've written
- If available, look for email threads or Slack messages

Analyze 3-5 samples before asking questions so you can reference specific examples.

## Opening Question
"Now I'd like to understand how you communicate. Think about the last few messages or documents you wrote — how would you describe your writing style?"

## Core Questions

### Writing Style
1. "Are you more of a 'get to the point' writer or do you provide context before the ask?"
2. "Do you tend to write long-form or keep things short?"
3. "Do you use bullet points, numbered lists, or prose paragraphs?"
4. "How do you structure an email or message when you need something from someone?"

### Tone Spectrum
5. "How does your tone change between different audiences? For example, your team vs. leadership vs. external partners?"
6. "When do you use humor or casual language? When do you stay formal?"
7. "How do you deliver feedback — direct and blunt, or softened and diplomatic?"
8. "How does your tone shift when you're excited about something vs. frustrated?"

### Patterns & Habits
9. "Do you have any phrases or words you find yourself using often?"
10. "How do you typically open a message? Close it?"
11. "Do you use emojis, exclamation marks, or other stylistic markers?"
12. "When you disagree with someone in writing, how do you phrase it?"

### Medium Preferences
13. "When do you choose to write vs. call vs. have a meeting?"
14. "How do you communicate urgent issues differently from routine ones?"
15. "Do you prefer async communication or synchronous?"

### Artifact Analysis
- Reference a specific document found via MCP:
  "I found [this document/message]. Can you tell me about the context? Is this typical of how you write?"
- Point out patterns you noticed:
  "I noticed you tend to [use X pattern] — is that deliberate?"

## Follow-up Probes
- "Can you share an example of a message you were proud of?"
- "What about one that didn't land well?"
- "If someone impersonated your writing, what would give them away?"

## What to Record
```yaml
communication:
  writing_style: [synthesized description of overall style]
  tone_spectrum:
    formal: [when and how they're formal]
    casual: [when and how they're casual]
  patterns:
    - [pattern 1 — e.g., "Opens with context before the ask"]
    - [pattern 2 — e.g., "Uses numbered lists for action items"]
    - [pattern 3]
  email_examples:
    - [anonymized excerpt demonstrating style]
  vocabulary:
    - [characteristic words/phrases they use]
```

## Transition
"I've got a great sense of how you communicate. Here's what I'm seeing... [summary]. Now let's talk about how you make decisions — your thought process when facing choices and tradeoffs."
