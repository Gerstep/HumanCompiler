# Phase 5: Work Patterns

## Objective
Understand how this person works day-to-day — routines, tools, collaboration habits, meeting behavior, and task management approach.

## MCP Pre-work
- Search Asana for their task patterns: how they title tasks, use sections, set due dates
- Search Notion for project trackers, wikis, or workflow docs they maintain
- Look at meeting notes patterns via Notion meeting notes query

## Opening Question
"Walk me through a typical work day. From when you start to when you stop — what does it look like?"

## Core Questions

### Daily Routine
1. "What's the first thing you do when you start work?"
2. "How do you structure your day? Do you have blocks, themes, or is it reactive?"
3. "When do you do your best deep work? How do you protect that time?"
4. "What's your relationship with notifications and interruptions?"
5. "How do you end your day? Any rituals for wrapping up?"

### Tools & Systems
6. "What are the tools you use every day? Which are essential vs. nice-to-have?"
7. "How do you track your to-dos and priorities?"
8. "Do you have a personal productivity system (GTD, time-blocking, etc.)?"
9. "How do you organize information — notes, docs, bookmarks?"

### Collaboration Style
10. "How do you prefer to work with others — pair/mob or solo then sync?"
11. "When you need something from someone, how do you typically approach them?"
12. "How do you share work-in-progress vs. finished work?"
13. "How do you handle being blocked by someone else?"

### Meeting Behavior
14. "How many meetings do you have in a typical week? How do you feel about that?"
15. "What's your role in meetings — do you lead, facilitate, contribute, or observe?"
16. "How do you prepare for meetings?"
17. "What makes a meeting feel worthwhile to you vs. a waste of time?"

### Task Management
18. "How do you break down large projects into tasks?"
19. "How do you estimate effort or timelines?"
20. "How do you track progress on longer-term initiatives?"
21. "What does your review/QA process look like for your own work?"

## Follow-up Probes
- "Show me your Asana/task board — what's the organizing principle?"
- "What's the last workflow you improved or automated?"
- "When you're overwhelmed, what do you cut first?"

## What to Record
```yaml
work_patterns:
  daily_routine: [description of typical day]
  tools:
    - [tool 1 and how they use it]
    - [tool 2 and how they use it]
  collaboration_style: [how they work with others]
  meeting_behavior: [role in meetings, preparation habits, preferences]
  task_management: [how they track, prioritize, and complete work]
```

## Transition
"I've got a detailed picture of how you work. Here's my summary... [summary]. Now for something different — I want to explore how you handle unusual or difficult situations. These edge cases are what make an agent truly accurate."
